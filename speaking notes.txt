VueJs

	"Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable." --- https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/

	https://vuejs.org says:

	Approachable
		"Already know HTML, CSS and JavaScript? Read the guide and start building things in no time!"
	Versatile
		"An incrementally adoptable ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework."
	Performant
		"20KB min+gzip Runtime - Blazing Fast Virtual DOM - Minimal Optimization Efforts"

I don't enjoy "front-end" development as much as other types of programming / as much as I used to.

If there is a JS UI framework out there, chances are I've invested anywhere from a week to a year evaluating it/using it.
	jQuery, knockout, angularjs, react, durandal, aurelia, angular2+, ember, backbone, riot, mithril

I value...

	easy ramp up
	quality ecosystem
		- docs
		- libs
		- people
	predictable/reliable behavior of the fx/lib itself
	consistent api	
	fun to program (creators have empathy for developers)
	performance
	ability to integrate with other-libraries!!!!!!!

NOTHING has satisfied me in these areas as Vue has.


-----------

Emphasis
	"incrementally adoptable"
		plop vue.js into page
		write vue app. done.
		no build pipeline		
		no grulp/webpackify
		just like circa 2008 naive jQuery goodness. but better.
		BUT! if you want the "robustness" of modern frontend development
